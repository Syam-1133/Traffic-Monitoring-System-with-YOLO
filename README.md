# 🚗 Traffic Monitoring System with YOLOv8 🚦

## Overview
This is a real-time traffic monitoring system designed to detect vehicles, estimate their speed, and count the number of vehicles entering and exiting a specified region. It uses the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) model for vehicle detection and provides useful insights such as the speed of vehicles and their count.

This system can be used for various traffic management applications, including congestion monitoring, traffic flow analysis, and automatic vehicle counting.

## Key Features 🌟
- **Real-Time Vehicle Detection**: Uses YOLOv8 for accurate detection of vehicles such as cars, trucks, motorcycles, and buses 🚙 🚚 🏍️.
- **Speed Estimation**: Estimates the speed of vehicles based on the time taken to cross two defined regions in the frame ⏱️.
- **Vehicle Counting**: Counts the number of vehicles entering and exiting the region of interest (ROI) 📊.
- **Customizable ROI**: Define custom regions of interest for better vehicle speed tracking and flow analysis 🎯.
- **Video Processing**: Supports processing of both pre-recorded video files and live webcam feed 🎥.
